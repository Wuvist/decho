# decho

`decho` is a demo project utilizing:

* Dependency Injection with [wire](https://github.com/google/wire)
* Web framework [echo](https://echo.labstack.com).
* Configuration with [toml](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml)

The idea is to build modularized & testable web applicaiton, and it's inspired by [micronaut](https://micronaut.io/).
